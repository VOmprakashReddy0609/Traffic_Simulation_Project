# 🚦 Traffic Simulation Project

A Python-based traffic simulation project built using **Pygame** that visually demonstrates vehicle movement across a four-way (X-junction) intersection. This project simulates real-world traffic rules, including vehicle movement control, automatic U-turns, and directional traffic restrictions.

## 🛣️ Overview

This simulation models how vehicles interact at an X-junction, obeying traffic signals and rules such as:
- Only one direction of traffic is allowed at a time to avoid collisions.
- Vehicles automatically stop when another direction is active.
- Some vehicles intelligently take U-turns based on their path logic.
- Visual elements include animated cars, roadways, and signals.

## 🎮 Features

- 🔄 Simulates traffic flow at an X-junction intersection
- 🚗 Vehicles dynamically move and stop based on signal logic
- ↩️ Automatic U-turn functionality for select vehicles
- ⛔ Traffic restrictions to ensure safety and realistic behavior
- 🎨 Custom graphics for vehicles and roads (can be easily modified)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
